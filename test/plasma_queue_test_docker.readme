Install ray on docker.

# cd ray
# ./build-docker.sh

This would take some time, typically an hour or so. The installed docker image is Ubuntu. 

After installation, we have the following docker images for ray:

zhijunfu@localhost:~/Code/ray.fzj$ docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ray-project/examples    latest              608d8ceeb56b        24 hours ago        8.45GB
ray-project/deploy      latest              b3e214a6e2fb        24 hours ago        5.35GB
ray-project/base-deps   latest              946d401dbbeb        2 days ago          2.27GB
ubuntu                  xenial              5e8b97a2a082        3 days ago          114MB

Then we can create two docker containers:

docker run --shm-size=1g -t -i  --name=ray1 ray-project/deploy
docker run --shm-size=1g -t -i  --name=ray2 ray-project/deploy

So we have:

zhijunfu@localhost:~/Code/ray.fzj$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
99d711a46b07        ray-project/deploy   "/bin/bash"         21 hours ago        Up 43 minutes                           ray2
f3559e14813a        ray-project/deploy   "/bin/bash"         21 hours ago        Up 44 minutes                           ray1

  Note: If containers are stopped, later you could use the following commands to start an existing container and login:

  zhijunfu@localhost:~/Code/ray$ docker start ray2
  zhijunfu@localhost:~/Code/ray$ docker exec -it ray2 bash

Then we setup a ray cluster with containers ray1 and ray2. Say we decide to start redis on ray2:

On ray2, we do:

# ray start --head --redis-port=6379 --resources='{"Resource2": 4}'

On ray1:

# ray start --redis-address 172.17.0.3:6379 --resources='{"Resource1": 2}'

Then resources are used to make sure queue writer and queue reader are scheduled to different nodes.

For the script, we add resource requirements so that queue provider A would be scheduled to ray1, 
and queue receiver B would be scheduled to ray2. We also need to add redis_address="172.17.0.3:6379" to ray.init(),
change the specific ip & port appropriately.


# Provider A nd Receiver B using plasma queue
@ray.remote(resources={'Resource1': 2})
class A(object):
  ...

@ray.remote(resources={'Resource2': 4})
class B(object):
  ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ray.init(redis_address="172.17.0.3:6379")
